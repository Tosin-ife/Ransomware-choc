# File Encryption and Decryption Scripts

This is just a cryptographic Python ransomware designed to encrypt and decrypt files, after paying a ransom of chocolate...

This repository contains two Python scripts: one for encrypting files in the current directory and another for decrypting them. These scripts use the `cryptography` library to secure file contents with symmetric encryption.

## Features

- **Encryption Script (`encrypt.py`):** Encrypts all files in the directory except for the script itself and the key file.
- **Decryption Script (`decrypt.py`):** Decrypts the encrypted files using a secret key and passphrase.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library

You can install the `cryptography` library using pip:

```sh
pip install cryptography
```
# Encrypting Files
Clone this repository or download the scripts.

Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.

Run the encryption script:

```sh
python3 voldermot.py
```
This will generate an encryption key (thekey.key) and encrypt all files in the directory except for the script files and the key file.

# Decrypting Files
To decrypt the files, you need the thekey.key file generated by the encryption script and the correct secret passphrase.

Run the decryption script:

```sh
python3 decrypt.py
```
Enter the secret phrase when prompted.

If the correct passphrase is provided, the script will decrypt the files.

# Disclaimer
These scripts are for educational purposes only. Do not use them to encrypt files without the owner's permission. The scripts use basic encryption and should not be considered secure for sensitive data. Always back up your data before running any encryption script.
